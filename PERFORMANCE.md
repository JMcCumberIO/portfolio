# Portfolio Website Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines key performance optimizations implemented in the portfolio website.

## Current Optimizations

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- Critical path components (Navbar, Hero, Footer) are eagerly loaded
- Non-critical components use React.lazy() for code splitting
- Suspense boundaries with loading indicators for a better user experience

### Image Optimization
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP where possible)
- Implement responsive images with srcset
- Apply proper image compression

### CSS Optimizations
- Tailwind's JIT compiler to minimize CSS bundle size
- Purge unused CSS in production builds

## Future Optimizations

### Performance
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG)
- Add HTTP/2 support for parallel loading of assets
- Use service workers for offline capabilities and caching

### Monitoring
- Implement web vitals monitoring
- Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Configure Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing

### Accessibility
- Complete ARIA implementation
- Keyboard navigation improvements
- Color contrast checks

## Performance Testing

To test the performance of the website, you can use:

1. Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
2. WebPageTest.org
3. GTmetrix
